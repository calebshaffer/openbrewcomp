<% @page_title = 'Purge Old Data' %>

<% if @allowed -%>
  <p>
    This page allows you to purge old data from the
    <%= PurgeOldData.tables_to_clear.to_sentence.gsub('_',' ') -%> tables
    and the BJCP points and organizer designation saved in the judges table.
    Such a purge should be done prior to enabling online registration for
    a new competition to prevent the previous year&rsquo;s data from
    inteferring with the data for a new competition.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>WARNING:</strong> Do not purge old data until you are positive
    that you no longer need the old data. A database backup is highly
    recommended before you proceed.
