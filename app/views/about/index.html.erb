<p>
    Welcome to the 19th World Cup of Beer. One of the largest homebrew competitions in California with
    713 entries last year. An MCAB qualifier. Some of the best judges in the area. And a great party
    for the awards ceremony, hosted by Linden Street Brewing, who beyond being a great place to hold a comp,
    will be brewing the Best of Show beer again this year.
