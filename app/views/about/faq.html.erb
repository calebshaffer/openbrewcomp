      I&rsquo;m unable to delete (or edit, or print a bottle label for)
      an entry I&rsquo;ve registered.  The link is inactive.  What&rsquo;s
      wrong?
    </dt>
    <dd>
      <p>
        If the link to delete, edit, or print a bottle label for an entry
        is inactive, it means that your entry has been received and checked
        in. Once this happens, you cannot delete the entry or change any
        information about it. It&rsquo;s also rather pointless to print a
        bottle label for such an entry, don&rsquo;t you think?
      </p>
      <p>
        If you sent your entries in early and you are still able to edit or
        delete some, or all, of them, don&rsquo;t panic. It just means that
        your entries have not yet completed the check-in process. Assuming,
        of course, that we actually received your entries.

          Can I sign up offline?
      </dt>
      <dd>
          No. Due to the number of entries, all registration is being handled online this year and
          you will need to fill out the entry forms via this site.

          Can I pay by check?
      </dt>
      <dd>
          We'd really prefer you pay online, as it makes tracking of entries easier for
          us and simplifies checkin for us. If you have problems with Paypal, please
          contact the competition coordinator to work out an alternative.

        When do I need to have my bottles to Oak Barrel.
    </dt>
    <dd>
        Your entries need to be in by February 12th by noon. If you are shipping, please allow
        time for travel time so that the entries will be there by the 12th.
